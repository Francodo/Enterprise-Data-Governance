Background

Hall of Sneakers is a fictional online trading company. The store provides a trading platform for Sellers and Buyers of used Sneakers.
Buyers can bid for shoes or buy them outright, and sellers can set a price or sell to the highest bidder. Each buyer and seller must have an active account in order to sell, bid, or purchase sneakers using Hall of Sneaker’s website.

Sneaker shoes are inspected and authenticated before being listed. So, before listing an item, the seller must ship it to Hall of Snekers’s warehouse. Upon receipt, Hall of Sneakers assigns an item number to each pair of sneakers and notifies the seller that they are now free to list their item. If the item is not listed within 45 days, SneakerPark returns the sneakers to the seller and sends an invoice to the seller for the shipping cost.

If the item is found to be inauthentic or in an unacceptable condition, it is also returned back to the seller in a similar fashion.

When the item sells, the seller's account is credited with the purchase price minus the Hall of Sneakers's service shipping fees to deliver the item to the buyer.

Project Motivation

Hall of Sneakers business has expanded over the past year and with some growing pains. As the number of sellers, buyers, items, and sales increased, the company started running into discrepancies between systems which resulted in mischarges, lost revenue, and frustrated customers. With this in mind, Sneaker Park has decided to invest in an Enterprise Data Management program to gain better visibility and control over their data systems.

Phase 1 of this initiative focuses on creating the foundational data management tools and artifacts that will allow Hall of Sneakers to better manage their data now and in the future. More specifically, this entails:
(a) documenting SneakerPark's data systems
(b) setting up a data catalog
(d) designing better data quality and master data management processes
(e) formalizing data governance roles.

As a newly hired Data Architect, you are asked to technically lead the Enterprise Data Management Program and get started with the implementation of Phase 1.
